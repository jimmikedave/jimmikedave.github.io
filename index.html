                    <h4>
                        Like millions of other people around the globe, my relatively "normal" way of life was uprooted by COVID-19. I was originally an Operations Coordinator for an event production company, but the pandemic brought the entire event industry to a screeching halt. 
                        Since I was out of work, I decided to use this time to learn new skills and change my career path. 
                    </h4>
                    <h4>
                        I chose to learn Full Stack JavaScript and become a developer as I was fascinated by how websites and apps were made. As a Treehouse graduate, I learned the ins-and-outs of adding interactivity into browsers, using JavaScript in server side syntax, and built this portfolio site to showcase my work as a Full Stack JavaScript Developer. 
                        I aspire to work as a developer creating user-friendly and interactive experiences on their websites and apps. I thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio!
